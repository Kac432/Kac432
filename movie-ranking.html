<h1>The Best Movies According to Kara</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Persuasion </h3>

<p>I love this movie because I love Jane Austen books. This is a really great movie that I reccomend watching.</p>

<h3>2. Pride and Prejudice</h3>

<p>I reccomend this movie because it is based off a Jane Austen book and I don't know what else to put here. I also like it because it is pretty similar to the book</p>

<h3>Ella Enchanted</h3>

<p> I like this movie because I can't think of another movie to put on this list.<br />
I don't really acutally like this movie very much but it's not all bad.</p>
